# AgenticCodeGenerator

A system that generates complete multi-module projects from a single high-level prompt.

## Project Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Compile dependencies (optional):**

    If you add new dependencies to `requirements.in`, you need to compile them into `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip-compile requirements.in > requirements.txt
    ```
